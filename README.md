GA HUSTLE: Virtual Aviation Operations Platform
This platform is a niche Virtual Airline (VA) management system dedicated to simulating the dynamic world of General Aviation (GA), air taxi, and small business jet operations within Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS). It provides a compelling break from the routine of commercial airliners by challenging pilots to "hustle" and manage highly opportunistic, point-to-point flights.

Key Features and Thematic Components:
Pilot Management Detailed pilot dashboard
pilots.db, index.html.

Job Market Focus on high-value, urgent, non-scheduled transport missions (e.g., organ transport, corporate shuttle, priority cargo) suitable for piston, turboprop, and light jet aircraft.
jobs.db, jobmarket.db, job_market.html.

Technology Core Robust, lightweight web application built with Python (Flask). Uses SQLite for all application data (Pilots, Fleet, Ledger, Jobs) and Bcrypt for secure authentication.
app.py, script.js, Database setup files.

Why This Platform is Unique:
The GA HUSTLE platform avoids large-scale airline simulation, focusing instead on the flexibility, quick decisions, and rewarding challenges of operating smaller aircraft into a diverse range of airports. It's built for pilots who enjoy the freedom and entrepreneurial spirit of flying the virtual skies on their own terms.
